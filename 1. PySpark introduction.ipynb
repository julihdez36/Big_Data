    "## introducing Apache Spark\n",
    "\n",
    "PySpark is an API to Apache Spark (or simply Spark). In other words, with pyspark we can build Spark applications using the python language. So, by learning a little more about Spark, you will understand a lot more about pyspark.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark is a multi-language engine for large-scale data processing that supports both single-node machines and clusters of machines (Apache Spark Official Documentation 2022). Nowadays, Spark became the de facto standard for structure and manage big data applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The most important feature of all, is that Spark is an unified platform for big data processing**. This means that Spark comes with multiple built-in libraries and tools that deals with different aspects of the work with big data. It has a built-in SQL engine for performing large-scale data processing; a complete library for scalable machine learning (MLib2); a stream processing engine for streaming analytics; and much more.\n",

    "Every Spark application is distributed into two different and independent processes: 1) a driver process; 2) and a set of executor processes (Chambers and Zaharia 2018). The driver process, or, the driver program, is where your application starts, and it is executed by the driver node. This driver program is responsible for: 1) maintaining information about your Spark Application; 2) responding to a userâ€™s program or input; 3) and analyzing, distributing, and scheduling work across the executors (Chambers and Zaharia 2018)."
